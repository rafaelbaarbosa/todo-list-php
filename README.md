# To-do list

## Instructions

1. To run this program correctly you will need to make some changes in the `init.php` code.
    * On the first value of PDO you will change `mysql:dbname=todo;host=localhost` to `mysql:dbname=<your-database-name-here>;host=<your-host-hear>`.
    * On the second value of PDO you will put the username of your MySQL instance.
    * On the third value of PDO you will put the password of your MySQL instance.
2. Next you will need to create a table on your database similar to this one:
